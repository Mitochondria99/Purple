For the following questions, you’ll look at the [SafeTransferLib](https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/blob/efd63173997c6e30a2e45cd889cdd3968598a4c2/src/utils/SafeTransferLib.sol) from the Solady repo.

We’ll go over the `balanceOf` function together to get an initial understanding, the following questions pertain to the `safeTransferFrom`, `safeTransfer`, and `safeApprove` functions.

1. In the safeTransferFrom function, what does `0x23b872dd000000000000000000000000` represent and what does it mean when used in the following context on line 192: `mstore(0x0c, 0x23b872dd000000000000000000000000)`.

Ans.

    `0x23b872dd000000000000000000000000` represents the function signature of the transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 value) function.Function signatures in Ethereum are generated by taking the keccak256 hash of the function's prototype and then taking the first 4 bytes of the resulting hash.

    Smart contracts talk to each other using specific commands(Opcodes), one of them is `mstore` which says,"Store the following data in memory at the given location".
    `0x0c` This is the memory location where we want to store our data.`0x23b872dd000000000000000000000000` This is the data we're storing. The first part, 0x23b872dd, is a "function selector" that represents the transferFrom function of an ERC20 token contract. It's like saying "transfer funds from one account to another" at location` 0x0c`

2. In the `safeTransferFrom` function, why is `shl` used on line 191 to shift the `from` to the left by 96 bits?

Ans.

When encoding for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), the layout of function selectors and the arguments in memory would be:

First 4 bytes: Function selector (`0x23b872dd`)
Next 32 bytes: `from` address
Next 32 bytes: `to address`
Last 32 bytes: amount or value

However, Ethereum addresses are only 20 bytes long. When stored in a 32-byte word, the address takes up the last 20 bytes of the word, with the first 12 bytes (or 96 bits) being zeros.
So, when `` mstore(0x2c, shl(96, from))// Store the `from` argument `` is executed, it's placing the `from `address into the latter part of the 32-byte word. `The shl(96, from)` is shifting the `20-byte` from address to the left by `96 bits`, so when it's stored in memory, it will occupy the last 20 bytes of that 32-byte segment, aligning it correctly for the function call.

3. In the `safeTransferFrom` function, is this memory safe assembly? Why or why not?

   Yes,this is memory safe assembly.
   The function starts with `let m := mload(0x40)` which fetches the current **free memory pointer** in Ethereum. This pointer indicates where in memory you can safely start writing data without overwriting anything important.
   At the end of the function, with mstore(0x40, m), it resets the memory pointer back to its original position, ensuring that subsequent operations won't accidentally overwrite the memory we've just used.

   The function stores its variables at specific memory locations (0x60, 0x40, 0x2c, etc.). By doing so, it avoids any accidental overwrites. There's a clear detail of where each piece of data is stored.
   The function checks the outcome of the call (which attempts the transfer). If the call isn't successful, the function reverts the transaction with an error, ensuring that failures are handled without any unpredictable outcomes.

4. In the `safeTransferFrom` function, on line 197, why is 0x1c provided as the 4th argument to `call`?

   In the provided safeTransferFrom function, the call function is used to invoke another contract. The call function in Solidity's inline assembly has the following format:

```assembly
call(gaslimit, to, value, in_offset, in_size, out_offset, out_size)

```

gaslimit: The maximum amount of gas provided for the call.
to: The address of the contract being called.
value: The amount of ether (in wei) sent with the call.
in_offset: The starting position in memory where the input data is located.
in_size: The size (in bytes) of the input data.
out_offset: The starting position in memory where the output data will be stored.
out_size: The size (in bytes) of the space allocated for the output data.

```assembly

    call(gas(), token, 0, 0x1c, 0x64, 0x00, 0x20)
```

0x1c is provided as the in_offset. This means that the input data for this call starts from memory location 0x1c.

5. In the `safeTransfer` function, on line 266, why is `revert` used with `0x1c` and `0x04`.

   The revert function in Solidity's inline assembly is used to stop and revert the current call, essentially canceling all state changes made during the call.
   `revert(start_position, size)`

   start_position: This is the memory location where the revert reason/data begins.
   size: This is the size, in bytes, of the revert reason/data.

   `revert(0x1c, 0x04)`

   0x1c: This represents the starting memory location of the revert reason/data.
   0x04: This indicates that the length of the revert reason/data is 4 bytes.

   If the transfer fails, the function stops and reverts any state changes, sending back an error message or code that's 4 bytes long and starts from memory location 0x1c.

6. In the `safeTransfer` function, on line 268, why is `0` mstore’d at `0x34`.

The memory location 0x34 was used temporarily to store a value (amount). Before exiting the function, the code is resetting that memory spot by setting it to 0. It's a way of cleaning up after using the memory to avoid errors.

7. In the `safeApprove` function, on line 317, why is `mload(0x00)` validated for equality to 1?

   `  or(eq(mload(0x00), 1), iszero(returndatasize()))`

   The eq(mload(0x00), 1) part of this line checks if the value at memory location 0x00 is equal to 1.

   `` mstore(0x00, 0x095ea7b3000000000000000000000000) // `approve(address,uint256 ``

   This line is storing the function signature for approve(address,uint256) in memory at location 0x00.

   Now, after the call function, which invokes the approve function on the provided token, if the token's approve function was implemented such that it returns a boolean (which is a common practice in ERC-20 tokens, where true is often returned on a successful call), then this boolean value would be what is stored at memory location 0x00 after the call.

   In the Ethereum VM, a boolean true is represented by 1, and false by 0. Therefore, eq(mload(0x00), 1) is essentially checking if the approve call returned true

8. In the `safeApprove` function, if the `token` returns `false` from the `approve(address,uint256)` function, what happens?

   1. The approve function will return false, which in Ethereum is represented by 0.
   2. The memory location 0x00 will then hold this value (0).
   3. The condition eq(mload(0x00), 1) will evaluate to false (or 0 in EVM terms) 4.because the memory location 0x00 does not hold a 1.
   4. If there's no return data (the approve function returns nothing), then iszero(returndatasize()) would be true (or 1 in EVM terms). However, since the function did return a value (false), this condition would evaluate to false as well.
      Given that both conditions in the or statement are false, the entire or statement evaluates to false.
   5. The` and` statement would then also evaluate to false because it contains a false condition (the result of the or statement).
   6. The outermost if iszero(...) would evaluate to true since the and operation evaluated to false.
   7. As a result, the code inside the if block will execute. It will store the error code for ApproveFailed() in memory location 0x00 and then invoke the revert function with arguments 0x1c and 0x04 to halt execution and revert all state changes.

   To put it simply, if the approve function returns false, the safeApprove function will detect this and trigger a revert with an error code indicating the approval failed.
